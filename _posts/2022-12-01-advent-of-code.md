Christmas is around the corner. On the 1st of December, we usually get a new [advent calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_calendar).
It means that kids may get every day before Christmas some sweets. For programers brings the [advent calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_of_Code)
each day new challenge. If we solve those challenges we will get a working mobile operating system under the Christmas tree.

The tasks will be published here:

## 1 – hello world

As a starter task, you should prepare your [developer environment](https://nemomobile.net/installation/). Install Manjaro Linux into the Virtual machine and install the nemomobile packages on it.
Install the image on an SD card and try it. Let us know if you managed to do that. Share your experience [with us](https://telegram.me/nemomobile). Make some photos as proof.

## 2 – letter for Santa Claus

Santa Claus and his elves already received some of your letters. Elves are doing everything to keep the position of Santa’s
place secret. They avoid google or apple cloud services, but they already managed to get your letters into the phone.

Santa Clause is an elderly person and his sight is not what it used to be. Unfortunately,
the [Pinch to zoom](https://github.com/nemomobile-ux/glacier-gallery/issues/20) function
in the Gallery application doesn’t work smoothly and seamlessly as expected. Your task is to fix zoom problem and
save Christmas, otherwise some children may not get their presents.
