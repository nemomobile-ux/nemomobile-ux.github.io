Christmas is around the corner. On the 1st of December, we usually get a new [advent calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_calendar).
It means that kids may get every day before Christmas some sweets. For programers brings the [advent calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_of_Code)
each day new challenge. If we solve those challenges we will get a working mobile operating system under the Christmas tree.

The tasks will be published here:

## 1 â€“ hello world

As a starter task, you should prepare your [developer environment](https://nemomobile.net/installation/). Install Manjaro Linux into the Virtual machine and install the nemomobile packages on it.
Install the image on an SD card and try it. Let us know if you managed to do that. Share your experience [with us](https://telegram.me/nemomobile). Make some photos as proof.
